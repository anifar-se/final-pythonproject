# **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker**

## **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Analyze and visualize COVID-19 global trends using historical case data.
- **Dataset Used:** `covid_global_data.csv` containing daily reported cases, deaths, and country-level statistics.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

---

## **Objectives**
- Track **global COVID-19 trends** with real-world data.
- Understand **daily cases, deaths, and country-wise distributions**.
- Identify **patterns in pandemic spread** over time.
- Compare **cases across different countries**.

---

## **Setup Instructions**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Load the Dataset
Ensure the dataset file covid_global_data.csv is in the project directory.

Run the Python script provided.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration
Check dataset structure using df.info().

Handle missing values with df.fillna(df.mean()).

Compute summary statistics using df.describe().

Observations & Reflections
üìä General Dataset Insights
Dataset includes X records with country, date, cases, deaths, and continent.

Missing values filled, ensuring complete analysis.

Variation in cases across regions, reflecting different pandemic responses.

üìå Patterns & Trends
Pandemic peaks observed, aligning with lockdown policies.

Fatality rates differ, indicating healthcare system effectiveness by country.

üìâ Statistical Findings
COVID-19 cases show spikes, possibly due to testing variations or outbreaks.

Certain regions report lower cases, possibly due to reporting discrepancies.

üîé Visualization-Based Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Line Chart: Clear upward trend in global cases, reflecting major pandemic waves. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bar Chart: Countries like X & Y show the highest total cases. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Histogram: Case distribution varies, with some extreme surges. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scatter Plot: Death rates higher in some regions despite similar case numbers.

Error Handling
Implemented try-except blocks to prevent dataset loading issues.

Managed missing values for accurate computations.

Verified dataset integrity before performing analysis.
